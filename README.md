This is a c++ project going over how to create collatz sequence starting with 1 and going to N while you are able to choose how many threads.
The output for the program will give an array of integers 0 to N with each  index being the stopping time and the value inside of each index being the frequency of it being stopped.
There were no problems with creating or running this project.
